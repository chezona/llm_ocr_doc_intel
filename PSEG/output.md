Gas bill credit! Effective for usage from Jan. 1, 2018 through Feb. 28, 2018, customers receiving BGSS-RSG supply service from PSE&G will receive a bill credit of $0.15/therm (incl. SUT). A typical residential heating customer receiving supply service from PSE&G, and using a total of 330 therms during this period will see a bill reduction of $49.50 (about 16.95%). Visit pseg.com/tariffs for more info.

Extreme frigid weather in December and January may have resulted in increased gas usage and higher gas bills. While customers are benefiting from gas bill credits this winter, there are ways to further manage winter heating costs. To learn more, visit pseg.com/saveenergy.
